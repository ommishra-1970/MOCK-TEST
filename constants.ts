**Question Paper Rules:**
- Exam Title: **Class-X (HSC) Pre-Board Examination**
- Time: **2 Hours 30 Minutes**
- Total Marks: 100
- Section A (Objective): 50 Marks. 50 MCQs (1 mark each). Q1-Q25 Physical Science, Q26-Q50 Life Science.
- Section B (Subjective): 50 Marks. 
  - Part 1: Physical Science (25 Marks).
    - 4 Questions of 2 marks each (with internal OR choice).
    - 3 Questions of 3 marks each (with internal OR choice).
    - 2 Questions of 4 marks each (with internal OR choice).
  - Part 2: Life Science (25 Marks).
    - 4 Questions of 2 marks each (with internal OR choice).
    - 3 Questions of 3 marks each (with internal OR choice).
    - 2 Questions of 4 marks each (with internal OR choice).
- **CRITICAL RULE FOR SUBJECTIVE:** For every subjective question with an internal "OR" choice, the alternative question MUST be from a DIFFERENT chapter than the main question. Do not ask two questions from the same chapter in one "OR" set.
- **CRITICAL RULE FOR MCQs:** 50% of the MCQs must be COMPETENCY-BASED. These should be longer questions involving scenarios, application of concepts, or reasoning, rather than simple definitions. The options should be plausible and detailed.
